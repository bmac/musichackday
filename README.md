# HTML5 Piano with Notes

## [Demo](http://bmac.github.com/musichackday/) 

This was a small project done in 24 hours for [Music Hack Day Boston](http://boston.musichackday.org/2012/index.php?page=Main+page).

Try to play the next note to complete the song.

I was inspired to create this by [Stuart Memo: JavaScript is the new Punk Rock -- JSConf EU 2012](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN8Eg1K9xjE).
